# Example WireGuard Demo Client for Windows

This is a simple client for demo.wireguard.com, which brings up WireGuard tunnels using the [embeddable-dll-service](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-windows/about/embeddable-dll-service/README.md).

## Building

The code in this repository can be built in Visual Studio 2019 by opening the .sln and pressing build. However, it requires [`tunnel.dll` and `wireguard.dll`](../README.md).
